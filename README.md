# Optimizing For Accessibility

This repository is to update the Horiseon codebase to meet accessibility standards. Beggining with refactoring and consolidating the base code to follow semantic structure and commenting on the CSS file to help when editing the code at a later date, ultimately designing the website to deploy tools and technologies for disabilities and for use on any device.

## Initial Functionality

Being designed for desktop viewing this website does not allow easy viewing at resolutions smaller than 768px which will be addressed after key accessibility tools are implemented.<br>
The CSS class components are easily minimized from the spread out layout shown.
