# Optimizing For Accessibility

This repository is to update the Horiseon codebase to meet accessibility standards. Beggining with refactoring and consolidating the base code to follow semantic structure and commenting on the CSS file to help when editing the code at a later date, ultimately designing the website to deploy tools and technologies for disabilities and for use on any device.
